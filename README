Provided files:
__settings__.py - sets common settings such as batch size and train/valid/test split.
data_loader.py - contains code for reading in raw text dataset and converting to model-friendly format.
models.py - contains custom pytorch models.
plotting.py - provides utils for plotting losses over time.
preprocessor.py - defines the preprocessor, same as in assignment 1.
training.py - contains code for training a pytorch model.
train_vector_classifier.py - runs a scikit-learn model on the dataset.
train_embedding_classifier.py - runs a pytorch model on the dataset.
train_word2vec.py - runs a pytorch model on the set of context windows in the dataset, and writes the resulting embeddings to a file.
train_pretrained_classifier.py - runs a pytorch model on the dataset, with embeddings read from a previously created file.
